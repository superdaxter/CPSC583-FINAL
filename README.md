# CPSC 583 Data Visualization - Final Project

## Introduction

My project is about cyber security breaches that took place between 2008-2014 in the healthcare sector of the United States. My goals for this project are to uncover relevant information from the data and be able to use this data to find trends/facts that would otherwise be invisible to us.I think the information in this dataset is extremely relevant to us with how we are developing as a society. It would be useful to see if there are any findings that can be uncovered from this data to perhaps predict future trends, or simply to relay this information to the end user in a presentable interactive manner.

## Data Description

Original Source: (**https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf**)

This dataset encompasses the security breaches that involved 500 or more health care or human records that were reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as of June 27th, 2014. In the dataset, we are given a row for each of the cyber-attacks. The columns provide information on the specified attack, including information regarding the entity that was targeted, the date it occurred on, the type of breach and the location of the breach to name a few.

With the increased use of technology in every aspect of society, I think it is very important to know that the data being stored is secure. This dataset will help provide an insight into just how prevalent these attacks really are, and how these attacks are occurring. In addition, this dataset is limited to the healthcare sector which I think is a very important as the data that these entities receive is very personal to the individual providing their information.

### Pros and Cons of Data Set

I would like to point out a few clear disadvantages working with this data. The first point is that the records mainly range from 2009-2014. I do not think this would be enough time to analyze trends based on a time standpoint. For example, have the locations of these breaches changed, and how do the number of cyber-attacks compare to the last 5 years? I think this is important to note because the rate at which technology is being integrated has changed more so in recent years, than those before.

To add to this, the data recorded is only dealing with cases in the United States. This limits the ability to compare and visualize other countries against the US and analyzing data from around the world. The United States is one of the most developed countries currently, and I would be curious as to how this compares with developing and emerging countries.

On the other hand, this data set is very useful because of the array of information it provides. I think that because the dataset is large enough, it allows for certain types of queries to take place. For example, it contains the state in which the attack occurred which allows us to analyze the geographical location on a nation-wide scale. This opens the possibility to find for example, the state in which the most cyber-attacks occur,and perhaps, the type of breach that is most prevalent in said state.

If there was less data provided in this dataset, I think that it would make these types of questions hard to answer, and this is also attributed to the United States being a country with a relatively large population.
